# Distributed Backup Service

This project is a distibuted backup service for a local area network (LAN). The objective is to use unused disk space of the computers in a LAN for backing up files in other computers in the same LAN. Te service is provided by servers, one per computer, in an environment that is assumed cooperative (rather than hostile). Nevertheless, each server retains control over own disks and, if needed, may reclaim the space it made available for backing up other computers' files.
